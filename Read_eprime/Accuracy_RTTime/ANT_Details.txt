The alerting effect was calculated by subtracting the
mean RT of the double-cue conditions from the mean
RT of the no-cue conditions. (no_cue - center_cue)
0	0	1	-1	0

The conflict (executive control) effect was calculated
by subtracting the mean RT of all congruent flanking
conditions, summed across cue types, from the mean RT
of incongruent flanking conditions. (Incongruent RT - Congruent RT)
-1	1	0	0	0


The orienting effect was calculated by subtracting the
mean RT of the spatial cue conditions from the mean RT
of the center cue. (center_cue - spatial_cue)

0	0	0	1	-1
